# Code for "Minimax Optimal Regression over Sobolev Spaces via Laplacian Eigenmaps on Neighborhood Graphs"

This is the code used to generate the data and plots in the paper "Minimax Optimal Regression over Sobolev Spaces via Laplacian Eigenmaps on Neighborhood Graphs".

To generate data used in experiments on estimation and parameter tuning, run `estimation_mse_pipeline.R`.  
To generate data used in experiments on testing, run `testing_error_pipeline.R`.

Configurations for different experiments are in `configs/`.
Scripts used to generate figures are in `plots/`.
